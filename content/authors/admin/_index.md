Hi, I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Naples Federico II. In 2024 I completed the PhD in **Information Technology and Eletrical Engineering** ([ITEE](https://itee.dieti.unina.it/)) at the **Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering** ([DIETI](https://www.dieti.unina.it/index.php/en/)), University of Naples Federico II. My research focuses on Causal-Reasoning-Based testing of DNN-enabled software systems and microservice architectures. I am a member of the **DEpendable and Secure Software Engineering and Real-Time Systems** ([DESSERT](https://dessert.unina.it/)) research group. I'm also the Co-Founder of **ai.res** ([ai.res](https://ai-res.it/)) (spin-off of the University of Naples Federico II), where we develop AI risk management and governance solutions.
